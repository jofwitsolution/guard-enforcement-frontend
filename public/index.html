      content="In most countries of the world, it is now the trend for private security organizations to take on the challenge of carrying out primary security duties, and sharing information with individuals and organizations as a preventative measure to security problems. Thatâ€™s the role Guard Enforcement and Patrol plans to fulfill in your life and that of your organization. Guard Enforcement Security and Patrol Limited is not any run-of-the-mill security outfit. We are an indigenious private security company with tentacles in the United States of America."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
